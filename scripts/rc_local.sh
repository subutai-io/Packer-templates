# updates /etc/rc.local to do a check for the local proxy server I use
# which is installed by default. If the proxy server configuration is
# present this will check if the proxy is actually there. If it is no
# problem, if it is not then the file is removed.
#
# this is a good approach since this will run one ping to check in user
# environments on the first start where the proxy is not found, once it
# is removed, this code will be disabled since the 02proxy file disappears.
#
# for my environment this a bit of a pita since the check and ping will
# always execute when the virtual machine box is used. this is ok for me
# to deal with.
