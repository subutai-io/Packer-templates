Vagrant Techniques
------------------

1. [Awesome Interactive Hack] (https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/2662#issuecomment-328838768), might substitute this with local host bash shell execution. Might be good for select menu to configure and drop a subutai.yaml file.
2. [Arguments and Env Vars] (https://goo.gl/VBGfgh), can be used with SUBINT (short for subutai interactive) to trigger local script to ask a few questions.
3. [Automatically Install Gems and Plugins] (https://gist.github.com/sneal/9242343) does not seem to work, can still look for other tactics. Nice [thread] (https://gist.github.com/sneal/9242343) on this.
